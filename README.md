ANALYSIS:
1 - It was intersting to analyze gender citibike statistics. We see that for the month of September 2019, overall,  the number of females riding the bike was higher than number of males/unknown. Younger generations in general had higher trip duration than older folks which makes sense with age, comes age related challenges in terms of physical strength.

2 - For 2020, we see similar statistics based on gender. The number of females riding the bike was higher than number of males/unknown and younger generation (15-30) tend to ride more than the older generation. 

3 - The most popular start and end location in Sep. 2019 was 8th Ave. and 31st St.

4 - The most popular start and end location in Sep. 2020 was 1st Ave. and 68th St.
